1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/abrower10612/CSE341/tree/main/week01/cse341-project-master


2. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

I was able to get the create user element working as well as the list of users.


3. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

To my knowledge, everything is working properly. 



4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.


The coolest thing I learned from this assignment was how GET and POST work within Node.js. I really thought it was cool to see how it navigates from page to page based on the POST that takes place. 



5. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

The instructions are confusing as there seems to be two versions of the instructions. I've done what I think is correct but it's hard to tell when the step by step is different in two different places. 



6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


I feel that my assignment falls into the 4 - Meets requirements section



7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

The justification for being in category 4 is that I followed the instructions as closely as possible, but I ran out of time before I was able to implement some creativity that excels above and beyond the requirements.
